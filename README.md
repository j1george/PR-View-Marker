# PR View Marker

For anyone who has gotten annoyed at having to move their cursor over to the "Viewed" button for every single changed file on a PR, this is for you.

With this userscript, you can now mark a file as viewed with a simple keystroke.

## Usage

Just install Tampermonkey and add the code from `prViewer.js`

- Backtick (`) to mark the next filechange as viewed.
- Escape (esc) resyncs in case a viewed state was manually toggled.
